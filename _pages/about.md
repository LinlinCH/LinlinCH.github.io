About me
======
I am Lin Chen, a Ph.D. candidate in the Electronic and Computer Engineering department at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). I received my B.S. degree in Integrated Circuit Design and Integration System from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China in 2020. Since 2020, I joined the Big Data System Lab at HKUST. My supervisor is Prof. Jiang Xu. My current research interests cover power management, machine learning and energy-efficient computer architecture.
